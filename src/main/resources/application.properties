spring.datasource.hikari.idleTimeout = 28800000
# Default maxLifeTime: 1800000 ms. This might be too high when compared to our database time-out.
# If maxLifeTime is higher than the database timeout, when a MySQL connection times out, Hikari expects it to still be open
# And it is thus how we get the exception that we usually see.
# The strange thing is that the MySQL time_out property is 28800 seconds by default, which is equal to 8 hours;
# 8 hours should be more than enough for the Hikari maxLifeTime default not to surpass it.
# Therefore, my best guess is that something on Azure or on Docker is the actual bottleneck.
